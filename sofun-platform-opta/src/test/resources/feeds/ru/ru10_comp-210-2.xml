England's biggest World Cup victory was in 2003 against Uruguay, where they recorded a 111-13 victory. England go into the tournament as current Six Nations champions, although they were denied a Grand Slam in their final match against Ireland. Martin Johnson, the England team manager who captained the side in 2003, will be hoping that his team can take some of that momentum into the 2011 edition of the World Cup.
