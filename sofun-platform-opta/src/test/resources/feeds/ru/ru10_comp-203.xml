Balshaw went to school at Stonyhurst College and joined Bath as a teenager in 1997. In 1998 Balshaw broke into the first team, scoring thirteen tries in his first full season. In 2000 he won his first England cap against Ireland in the Six Nations, as a substitute full-back, and was widely regarded as one of England’s future stars. It was only until 2001 that Balshaw made the starting line up for England at full-back in the 44-15 win over Wales at the Millennium stadium.

The versatile Balshaw has also operated on the wing and recently joined Gloucester from Leeds Carnegie, having made a total of 108 appearances for previous clubs Bath and Leeds, scoring 38 tries. Despite some frustrating injuries Balshaw’s career highlights include a World Cup winner’s medal in 2003, two Lions tours in 2001 and 2005 and receiving an MBE. Having scored 12 tries in 26 appearances for England, including a crucial try against Samoa in the semi final of the world cup, Balshaw is still widely regarded as a scintillating runner and a devasting game breaker.

Having missed out on the World Cup in 2007, Balshaw has been recalled to the England squad for the upcoming Six Nations, having scored 7 tries in 13 league and cup appearances for Gloucester this season. This try scoring form should see him as a real asset in the upcoming Six Nations tournament." sfms_id="" sub_appearances="1" team_id="1900" total_games="6" weight="83" />
