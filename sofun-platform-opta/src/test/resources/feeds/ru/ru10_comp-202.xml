Balshaw went to school at Stonyhurst College and joined Bath as a teenager in 1997. In 1998 Balshaw broke into the first team, scoring thirteen tries in his first full season. In 2000 he won his first England cap against Ireland in the Six Nations, as a substitute full-back, and was widely regarded as one of Englandâ€™s future stars. It was only until 2001 that Balshaw made the starting line up for England at full-back in the 44-15 win over Wales at the Millennium stadium.

The versatile Balshaw has also operated on the wing and recently joined Gloucester from Leeds Carnegie, having made a total of 108 appearances for previous clubs Bath and Leeds, scoring 38 tries. Despite some frustrating injuries Balshawâ€™s career highlights include a World Cup winnerâ€™s medal in 2003, two Lions tours in 2001 and 2005 and receiving an MBE. Having scored 12 tries in 26 appearances for England, including a crucial try against Samoa in the semi final of the world cup, Balshaw is still widely regarded as a scintillating runner and a devasting game breaker.

Having missed out on the World Cup in 2007, Balshaw has been recalled to the England squad for the upcoming Six Nations, having scored 7 tries in 13 league and cup appearances for Gloucester this season. This try scoring form should see him as a real asset in the upcoming Six Nations tournament." sfms_id="" sub_appearances="" team_id="1900" total_games="2" weight="83" />

He made his senior debut in 2004 against South Africa and further rewards followed in 2005 by being named Irish Rugby Union Playersâ€™ Association Player of the Year.

Having missed out in the opening 2005 Six Nations game against Italy, Oâ€™Connor returned to appear in the remainder of the tournament and further caps followed against New Zealand, Australia and Romania. In total Oâ€™Connor has 12 caps and 1 try for Ireland at senior level and his last appearance for Ireland was in 2006 against England.

Heroic in defence and unstoppable with the ball in his hands, there are no weak aspects to his game. O'Driscoll will go down as one of the greatest captains in rugby history, having captained the British and Irish Lions in 2005, as well as captaining Ireland at the 2007 World Cup. O'Driscoll has captained Ireland in more Tests than any other player and is also the highest try scorer in Six Nations history. O'Driscoll made his debut in 1999 against Australia and caught the attention of the rugby world two years later with a superb solo try against the same opposition for the British and Irish Lions. O'Driscoll has been a Lions tourist three times and was a crucial member of Ireland's World Cup squads in 2003 and 2007. " sfms_id="" sub_appearances="" team_id="2300" total_games="" weight="95" />

Having grown up in South Auckland playing rugby union, the explosive winger soon switched to rugby league representing the Canberra Raiders from 1997-2002 in the Australian National Rugby League. â€˜The Volcanoâ€™, as he is more affectionately known, scored 28 tries in 68 appearances for Canberra before moving to the Super League to play for the Bradford Bulls in January 2002. In his second full season Vainikolo was voted the best rugby league player in the world having scored a phenomenal 28 tries in 32 appearances for Bradford. He then proceeded to smash the Super League try scoring record the following season scoring 37 tries in 26 appearances, which included five hat tricks. 

At the end of June 2007 Vainikolo had scored an incredible 149 tries in 152 appearances for Bradford, and 11 tries in 12 appearances for New Zealand. This prompted a cross code switch to Gloucester rugby union club later that year. Vainikoloâ€™s phenomenal scoring record continued scoring five tries on debut against Leeds Carnegie in September 2007 and 9 in a total of 10 appearances so far this season.

Having successfully represented New Zealand at rugby league, Vainikolo now qualifies to play for England under residency rules and based on his previous scoring records is sure to make an impact in the upcoming Six Nations." sfms_id="" sub_appearances="" team_id="1100" total_games="1" weight="110" />

He plays for Cardiff Blues on the wing and only became a full time professional in 2007. In that same year James was selected to tour Australia with Wales but his debut didnâ€™t arrive until August 2007 against England. He announced himself by scoring a try on his Cardiff debut against Edinburgh within minutes of being on the field. The 20-year-old has also represented Wales at under 20 level as well as the sevens team.

In total Thom James has made 22 appearances for Cardiff and scored 10 tries. He has 2 Welsh caps and will hope to further add to that in the forthcoming Six Nations. Should he do so, his meteoric rise in the game of rugby will continue.

The 29-year-old had been tussling with Reggie Corrigan for the loose head spot for years until Horan eventually became the regular starter in 2005 Autumn Internationals.

In 2005, he returned to the Scotland team for the 2005 RBS 6 Nations after missing a year due to a knee injury that was sustained in the 2004 tournament. Taylor was awarded a place in the 2005 British and Irish Lions squad for the tour of New Zealand, however, he returned home from New Zealand without playing due to a hamstring injury. He was struck down by injury again in 2006, which lead to reconstructive surgery on his knee and therefore missed the summer tour of South Africa but he made his comeback in the 2006 Autumn Tests. He played in the match against Wales in February 2007 and became the 21st Scot to reach 50 caps; Taylor was also selected in the Scotland squad for the Rugby World Cup in France." sfms_id="" sub_appearances="" team_id="1000" total_games="2" weight="114" />
